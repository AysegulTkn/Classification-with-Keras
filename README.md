# Concrete Crack Image -Classification in Keras

In this project we are building an image classifier using the VGG16 pre-trained model and evaluating it. <br>
During this project we will use the data set "Concrete Crack Images for Classification". <br>
 Hier is [Dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavr10880/concrete-crack-images-for-classification)

## Used Libraries

* Keras
* TensorFlow
* pretrained VGG16 model
* numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* PIL

## Steps in Project

1. Loading Dataset
2. Visualization of sample images
3. Building Classifier using VGG16
4. Evaluation of Model
5. Make a prediction
